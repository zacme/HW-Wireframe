        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Born and raised in the Four Corners area of New Mexico but proud to be residing in Phoenix, Arizona since 2018. Graduate of the University of New Mexico. 
            Currently teaching a STEM class in an elementary school with an interest in web development. Enjoy visiting different areas around the country and taking photographs of landscape and cityscape scenery. 
            Time off is spent watching sports, reading books, house chores, and occasional video games. Fascinated by web development and eager to learn more. With a background in education I believe my soft skills will benefit me in a career in web development.
